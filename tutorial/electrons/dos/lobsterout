WARNING: 1 of 404 k-points could not be orthonormalized with an accuracy of 1.0E-5.
WARNING: Generally, this is not a critical error. But to help you analyze it,
WARNING: I dumped the band overlap matrices to the file bandOverlaps.lobster.

abs. charge spilling:   1.50%

NOTE: The spilling is a measure for the relocation, *not* the absence of electrons.
